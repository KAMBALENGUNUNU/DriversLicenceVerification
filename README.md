# Driver's License Verification Smart Contract

This project implements a simple smart contract in Solidity that allows a company or an authorized entity to register, verify, update, and revoke driver's licenses on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract ensures that the authenticity of a driver's license can be easily verified, providing a decentralized and secure way to manage driver's license data.

## Project Overview

The **Driver's License Verification** smart contract is designed to manage the lifecycle of driver's licenses. It allows authorized entities to:
- **Register** new licenses with holder details and validity periods.
- **Verify** the authenticity and validity of any registered license.
- **Revoke** a license if it is no longer valid.
- **Update** certain details, such as the holder's name or the expiry date.

This smart contract provides transparency, security, and immutability, ensuring that driver's license data cannot be tampered with and can be verified by anyone.
## Features

- **Registration of Licenses**: Authorized users can register new driver's licenses.
- **Verification**: Anyone can verify the authenticity of a license by querying the blockchain.
- **Revocation**: Authorized users can revoke a license, marking it as invalid.
