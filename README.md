# Driver's License Verification Smart Contract

This project implements a simple smart contract in Solidity that allows a company or an authorized entity to register, verify, update, and revoke driver's licenses on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract ensures that the authenticity of a driver's license can be easily verified, providing a decentralized and secure way to manage driver's license data.
